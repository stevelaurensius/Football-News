# Description
Made this "Football News Reader" as a proof of concept after learning how to retrieve and parse XML data.
It takes user input for football team name and number of entries to show.

<h2>My initial commit include this following feature:</h2>
- Team name verification. If XML data for the team is not found. It will show Error Message.
- Team name inputted by user are NOT case-sensitive.
- If number of number of entries to show is 0 or bigger than available news, it will shows all.
